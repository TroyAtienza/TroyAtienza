### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
I'm currently working on a website that allows users to add movies that they have seen or recommend on their profile, similar to Netflix's "My List". This academic project has a huge focus on the backend with Nodejs and Express as the backbone and Firebase as its main database for storing users and movies. This project also utilizes the Bootstrap framework to help alleviate some of the frontend as the team and I focus on the backend.

The main challenges from this project has been learning and getting the hang of how to properly use Nodejs, Express, and EJS. The next major upcoming challenge for this project would be its deployment to a cloud platform.
